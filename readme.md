For every changeset,

* Find the paths involved.
* Find the paths modified
* Find the owners for those paths


Determining owners
* If a root folder has an owner, the subfolder inherits ownership in addition
  to the specific people for that folder.
* Some folders have no owners - doc/tests for now.
